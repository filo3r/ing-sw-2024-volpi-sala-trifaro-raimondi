# Codex Naturalis
The project involves the development of a software version of the board game _Codex Naturalis_ as part of the Final Exam of the Software Engineering course for the academic year 2023-2024.  
The implementation consists in the creation of a distributed system based on client-server architecture, in which the server is able to manage one or more games simultaneously. Each game involves two or more clients, each representing a player, who can participate in only one game at a time.
